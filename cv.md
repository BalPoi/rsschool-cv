### Code example

**["Human readable duration format"](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52742f58faf5485cae000b9a) KATA from CODEWARS:**
*The number of seconds is set. The function translates seconds into a human-readable string.
For example, seconds = 3662, the function returns "1 hour, 1 minute and 2 seconds".
If seconds is zero, just "now" is returned. Otherwise, the duration is expressed as a combination of years, days, hours, minutes and seconds.*

```javascript
function formatDuration (s) {
  if (s === 0) return "now";
  const sArr = [31536000, 86400, 3600, 60, 1];
  const words = ["year", "day", "hour", "minute", "second"];
  let resArr = [];
  for (const i in sArr) {
    let n = s / sArr[i] | 0;
    s -= n * sArr[i];
    if (n) resArr.push(`${n} ${words[i]}${n > 1 ? 's' : ''}`);
  }
  return resArr.join(", ").replace(/(, )(\d* \w*$)/, (match, p1, p2) => ` and ${p2}`);
}
```
